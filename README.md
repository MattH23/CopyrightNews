## User Story
As an archivist, I would like to create a convenient way to track changes in copyright law that may affect libraries, museums, and other institutions.
Copyright laws are continuously changing. As archivists, we must be educated on copyright law and copyright reforms. An understanding of copyright law is necessary for archivists so that they may understand the materials in their collections and how these materials may be accessed, displayed, and preserved. The challenge is that copyright law is changing. While understanding the sections of The US Copyright Law is a foundation, laws are continuously being challenged, broken, and reformed. Therefore, we must have a way to track the changes to copyright law, as well as keep ourselves informed of current copyright disputes.
